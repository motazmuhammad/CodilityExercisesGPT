It is interesting that it was able to solve the problem from the first trial

This is the code explanation that chatgpt wrote

In this code, we traverse the binary representation of N bit by bit using bitwise operators.
We start at the least significant bit (i=0) and shift the binary representation of N to the right by i bits using the operator (1 << i). We then check if the bit at position i is 1 or 0 using the bitwise and operator &.

We use two additional variables: counting_gap is true when we are currently counting a binary gap, and current_gap_length is the length of the current binary gap. If we encounter a 1, we update max_gap_length if we were counting a binary gap and the current gap is longer than the previous longest gap, and then reset the gap length and start counting a new gap. If we encounter a 0, we increment the gap length if we are currently counting a gap.

Finally, we return max_gap_length.

Note that the time complexity of this algorithm is O(log N), where N is the input positive integer, because we need to traverse the binary representation of N once.
